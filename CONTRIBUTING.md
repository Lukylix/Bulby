# Contributing to Bulby

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the project
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/lukylix/bulby/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/lukylix/bulby/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample configurations

Bulby includes a lot of configuration options and is often deploying in larger systems. Please include as much information (configurations, deployment method, Docker & API versions, etc) as you can when reporting an issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give example configurations if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
